\section{Motivation and Goals}

Over the last years, significant progress has been made both on dynamic and static techniques to increase the quality of software. Within this track, we would like to investigate if and how we can leverage these techniques by combining them. Questions that will be addressed are for example: what can runtime verification bring to make static verification more cost effective, and what can static verification bring to make runtime verification more precise? The session will consist of several presentations on experiences combining the two techniques, and panel discussions.
