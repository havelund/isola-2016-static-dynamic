({\em Considering Typestate Verification for Quantified 
Event Automata})
sketches how static verification techniques for type states can be used on a commonly used specification framework for runtime verification, namely quantified event automata.
He gives an overview of type states and quantified event automata, and
then sketches on some example properties specified as quantified event
automata how type state techniques can be used.
