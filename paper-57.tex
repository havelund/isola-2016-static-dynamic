({\em StaRVOOrS â€” Episode II, Strengthen and Distribute the Force})
build on StaRVOOrS as presented at ISoLA 2012, which aims at a unifying framework for static and runtime verification of object-oriented software. 
Advances on a unified
specification language for data and control oriented properties, a
tool for combined static and runtime verification, and experiments are
presented. Future research concern (i) the use of static verification techniques to further optimize the runtime monitor, and (ii) extending the framework to the distributed case. A roadmap for addressing these challenges is presented.
