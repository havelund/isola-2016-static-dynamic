Azzopardi, Colombo, and Pace \cite{isola-2016-azzopardi} ({\em A
Model-Based Approach to Combining Static and Dynamic Verification
Techniques}) present how static and runtime verification can be used to
ensure safety of systems that are to be used in an unknown
context. The system developer has to provide a model of the
system. This model then is used to find the appropriate context for the
system to work in, and an attempt is made to statically verify the
desired properties of the composed system. Any property (or part of a property)
that cannot be verified statically will be verified
dynamically. Moreover, it will also be verified dynamically whether
the concrete implementation of the system respects the
model. In some cases, knowledge about the properties that
will be monitored can be used to reduce the model. The paper discusses
a concrete example of this approach for an online payment ecosystem.
