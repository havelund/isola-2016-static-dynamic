({\em On Combinations of Static and Dynamic Analysis})
elaborates in his presentation on the similarities and differences of
model checking and run-time verification, and how they can benefit
from each other. In particular, if model checking on an abstract
version of the system fails, how can run-time checking be used to
investigate the unsuccesful run. The presentation also discusses ideas
to use information obtained by static analysis to improve run-time
verification results.
