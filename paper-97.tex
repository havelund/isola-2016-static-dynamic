Leucker
\cite{isola-2016-leucker}
({\em On Combinations of Static and Dynamic Analysis})
elaborates in his presentation on the similarities and differences of
model checking and runtime verification, and how they can benefit
from each other. In particular, if model checking an abstract
version of the system fails, how can runtime verification be used to
investigate the unsuccessful run? The presentation also discusses ideas
for how to use information obtained by static verification to improve runtime
verification results.
