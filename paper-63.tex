Kosmatov, March\'{e}, Moy, and Signoles
\cite{isola-2016-kosmatov}
({\em Static versus Dynamic Verification in 
      Why3, Frama-C and SPARK2014})
describe the Why3 system, and two tools that use the Why3 system as a
backend, namely Frama-C and SPARK. As these systems focus on different
kinds of verification techniques (SPARK concentrates on runtime
verification, while Frama-C and Why3 favor static verification) and
properties of interest, there are differences in the specification
languages, in the treatment of ghost code, and in the treatment of
proof failures. The paper provides an in-depth discussion of these differences.
