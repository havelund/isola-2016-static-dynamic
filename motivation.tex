Over the last years, significant progress has been made both on static and dynamic program analysis techniques, focusing on increasing the quality of software. Within this track, we would like to investigate how we can leverage these techniques by combining them. Questions that will be addressed are for example: what can static analysis  bring to dynamic analysis to reduce
impact on execution time and memory use, and what can dynamic
analysis bring to static analysis to take over where
static analysis fails to either scale or provide precise results.
One can to some extent consider these two views (static supporting dynamic analysis, and dynamic analysis supporting static analysis)
as fundamentally representing the same kind of scenario: prove what can be proved statically, and dynamically analyze the rest. Dynamic analysis is also here referred to as runtime verification.

The session will consist of several presentations, some on the individual techniques, and some on experiences combining the two techniques. When preparing this session, we aimed at finding a balance between static and dynamic analysis backgrounds of the presenters. This is also reflected by the papers associated to this track. There are several papers describing systems that first attempt to verify as much as possible by static analysis, and then use dynamic analysis for the properties that cannot be verified statically. There is another group of papers that use static program information to generate appropriate run-time checks. Finally, a last group of papers discuss program specification techniques from static verification, and how they can be made suitable for runtime verification, or the other way round.

During the conference, three panel discussions on this topic are planned. The first panel focuses on static analysis. What does it need, and what can it bring to dynamic analysis? The second panel focuses on the opposite question: what does dynamic analysis need, and what can it bring to static static analysis? The last panel  discusses future research directions in this area, and what are the most promising ideas for combining static and dynamic analysis. Concrete topics that will be discussed include the limitations and benefits of each approach, how we can combine efforts to benefit verification, what are the overheads/benefits of combining efforts, industrial application in each area, industrial needs, etc.
