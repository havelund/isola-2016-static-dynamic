({\em Challenges in High-Assurance Runtime Verification}) 
first presents an overview of the Copilot RV framework, followed by
several challenges that are barriers to realizing
high-assurance runtime verification. More specifically, these
challenges relate
specification, observability of data, traceability from requirements,
fault tolerance, composition of RV and the system under observation,
monitor specification and monitor correctness. 
While the challenges are formulated generally, Goodloe addresses them
concretely in the context of the Copilot RV framework.
Additional challenges to be addressed in future work, as well as challenges regarding the use of automated verification tools for high-assurance RV, are also discussed.
