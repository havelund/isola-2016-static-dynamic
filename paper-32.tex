({\em Safer Refactorings})
present a method to avoid that refactorings can change the behaviour
of a program. 
Refactorings are a way to restructure a program's code. If a
refactorings is wrongly applied, this might actually change the
behaviour of the program, which should be avoided. Eilertsen et al. propose a technique to identify when the program's behaviour is actually changed. For two concrete refactorings (extract local variable, and extract and move method) they describe how this is done. Essentially, together with the refactoring they generate an assertion which will fail if the refactoring changed the program behaviour. To validate their approach, they automatically applied these refactorings on a large code base, and then used unit tests to identify how many assertions actually fail.
